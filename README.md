IPA keyboard layout for XKB
===========================

All credit for the idea and most of the work getting IPA symbols in some usable form goes to [Abu Jar M Akkas &lt;ajmakkas@ajmakkas.com&gt;](http://www.ajmakkas.com/pages/c_xkbipa.html), inspired by [Mark Huckvale's overlay](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/phonetics/).

About
-----

This is a custom keyboard layout for US keyboards which provides access to a number of IPA symbols via "dead keys" (using combinations of Right Alt / AltGr and Shift, plus ordinary keys). It has been tested and seems to work using XKB, and should be fairly easily usable with the majority of Linux distributions.

Installation
------------

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/frekky/xkb-ipa
cd xkb-ipa
```

Add the keyboard layout to your system (must be done as root):
```
sudo -i

cat us.ipa >> /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us
```

Add the following into the appropriate section of `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml`:
```
...
  <layoutList>
    <layout>
      <configItem>
        <name>us</name>      
        <shortDescription>en</shortDescription>
        <description>English (US)</description>
        <languageList>
          <iso639Id>eng</iso639Id>
        </languageList>
      </configItem>
      <variantList>
...

<!-- add this bit here -->
        <variant>
          <configItem>
            <name>uclphon</name>
            <description>English (US/intl, with AltGr dead keys for IPA overlay)</description>
          </configItem>
        </variant>
<!-- ----------------- -->

...
      </variantList>
    </layout>
```

Add the following bits into the appropriate sections of `/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst`:
```
! variant
  intl            us: English (US, intl., with dead keys)
...
  uclphon         us: English (US/intl, with AltGr dead keys for IPA overlay)
...
```

Test that setting the layout works with `setxkbmap us uclphon` (and back to regular US with `setxkbmap us basic`).

Finally you should be able to open Gnome/Cinnamon keyboard settings, and add the layout through the GUI. This will give you access to useful functionality such as using keybindings to switch layouts, and a panel applet which tells you which layout you are on.

Note that the `g` key actually produces a `É¡` character (which is the IPA symbol for a velar plosive, not a regular ASCII `g`). Be aware this may cause problems if you are typing commands or filenames while using the IPA keyboard.
